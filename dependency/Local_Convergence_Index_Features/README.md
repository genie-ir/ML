# Local-Convergence-Index-Features
Reimplementation of this paper with Python 

> Dashtbozorg B, Zhang J, Huang F, et al. [Retinal microaneurysms detection using local convergence index features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06865)[J]. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2018, 27(7): 3300-3315.

The results are different compared with that presented in the paper, experiment is in progress...

The source code scrips are not available from the authors due to commercial and copyright issues, also this version of python code **should be used for academic purpose only**.

Please feel free to contact me (chibing.xiang@gmail.com) if you are  interested in or working on Diabetic Retinopathy detection, I am looking for cooperation with any interested partners.
